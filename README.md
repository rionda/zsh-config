# Matteo's zsh config

In part inspired by [Nico](https://github.com/nviennot/).

## Key Bindings

`Ctrl + b` Go back in the directory location history
`Ctrl + f` Go forward in the directory location history
`Ctrl + u` Go up in the directory structure
`Ctrl + k` ls
`Alt + v` vim

Not ideal, I'm open to suggestions.
